# Calendar-Van Dusen Equation
Python repo for calibration constants for resistive temperature measurment typically platinum elements with R0 of 100Ω or 1000Ω

From Latin (A,B,C) to Greek (alpha, delta and beta) constants convertion and overview of many standard CVD figures is there is not a unique calibration performed on the temperatur meters.

where beta and C are used for temperatures under 0°C

Latin constants are traditional polynomial, but the greek way is a bit stranger. but it ends up beeing to ways of writing the same polynomial.

But this module converst from Latin constats to Greek constants and viseversa
